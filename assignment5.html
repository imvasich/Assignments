    <p>Lovejoy is an Indie Rock band from Britain. The four members, Joe, Mark, Ash, and Wilbur,<br>
      came together to form the band about two years ago. THe four have put out two EPs since then,<br>
      which were produced by Anvil Cat Records. The EPs "Are You Alright?" and "PebbleBrain" have<br>
      been a huge hit, with their most popular song "One Day" having over 52 million streams on Spotify.<br>
      Very excited to see what they put out next!
